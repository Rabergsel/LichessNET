## Usage
To use LichessNET in your project, you will have to include the `LichessNET.API` namespace:

Without Lichess Token
```C# Without Lichess Token
using LichessNET.API;
var client = new LichessAPIClient();
```

With Lichess Token
```C# With Lichess Token
using LichessNET.API;
var client = new LichessApiClient(/* YOUR OPTIONAL LICHESS TOKEN */);
//If your token became invalid, the client will fall back to not using a token.
```

## Code Snippets

<details>
  <summary>Access games from Lichess</summary>
  By Game ID:
  
  ```C#
    var game = await client.GetGameAsync("cFcjVWzn");
  ```

  Download from the monthly database:
  ```C#
     var database = new DatabaseClient();
     await database.DownloadMonthlyDatabase(2015, 1, ChessVariant.Atomic, "2015-01", false);
  ```

You can find the Game ID of a game in the URL of the game.
